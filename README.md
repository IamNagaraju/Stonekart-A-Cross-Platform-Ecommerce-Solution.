# Stonekart-A-Cross-Platform-Ecommerce-Solution.
Stone companies and freelance stonemasons sell their products directly to the consumer that is the offline in-store method. Stonekart provides the solution for buying these exclusive products in a few clicks. The aim of this hybrid application built on Angular(frontend) is to provide a multivendor e-commerce functionality and help to offer interfaces to two kinds of users, i.e., A buyer and a stonemason/stone Seller company. The use of the ionic framework that includes Apache Cordova makes it easy to access native functionalities on each platform. See publication Demonstration #Demofest - (Research Project)
