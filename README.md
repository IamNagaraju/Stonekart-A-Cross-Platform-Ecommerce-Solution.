Stonekart provides the solution for buying these exclusive products in a few clicks. The aim of this hybrid application built on Angular(frontend) is to provide a multivendor ecommerce functionality and help to provide interfaces for two kinds of users i.e. A buyer and a stonemason / stone Seller company.

MEAN stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS.
• As compared to traditional web-serving techniques where each connection(request) generates a new thread, using large amounts of the system RAM and eventually maxing it out , NodeJS operates on a single thread, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support thousands of concurrent connections(held in the event loop).
• MongoDB being easily scalable and schema less reduces the complexity of transformation logic because it releases JSON • Objects natively making writing of RESTful web services easy. • Express handles server-side routing and page-generation and I/O calls to and from the database.
• Emphasizing on client side views with the courtesy of Angular where it interacts with the NodeJS server. Moving from page-centric view of the application to one that is component-oriented. 
• MEAN stack is mobile centric i.e. Angular runs equally well on desktops, laptops, smartphones, tables and even smart TV’s.
